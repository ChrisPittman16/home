   <b>Trash Possum by FreemanArtpocalypse</b>
    I think possums are adorable, despite the reputation they often get. This little guy is just enjoying his meal, he's even got his little crown.

    <img src="https://chrispittman16.github.io/cpittman/images/TallCat.jpg">
  </p>
     <b>Le Chat Blanc by Pierre Bonnard</b>
    I am unsure as to why this artist (or any artist in the medieval or renaissance era), decided to make the cat the way they did, but I absolutely love it and have a strange fascination for it.

    The advanced idea, for those with special types of creativity, like myself.

     <b>Artwork of Kevin the cat by Vanessa Stockard</b>
     Somehow the giant yellow eyes and lack of other facial features and ears, as well as how small he 
    looks with that neck ruff around his neck, make this look like some exotic alien creature.

     <b>Fun House of Phobias by Stephen Gibb</b>
   This is both bizzarley freaky and kind of funny to me. It has this terrifying feel to it, but it still somehow looks goofy to me at the same time.

    <p style="font-size:25px;"> Cat Hungry for Fish</p>
    <img src="https://chrispittman16.github.io/cpittman/images/HungryCat.jpg">
  </p>
     <b>The Still Life Skate of Fish by Jean-Bapiste Simeon Chardin</b>
    Cats are inherently predatory, they have a lot of similar behaviors to the wild cats they descendeded from, this includes many of the young as well. This little guy is about to feast on a fish almost half his size and is trying to look intimidating, does he even realize just how small he is?

    <p style="font-size:25px;">Capybara taking a ride on a stork</p>
    <img src="https://chrispittman16.github.io/cpittman/images/CapyStork.jpg">
  </p>
     <b>Real Life</b>
    How is this even possible? Who knows?!? Maybe it's a really light Capybara, maybe it's a really strong stork, I am not knowlegable about how either of these 
    animals work. Just enjoy this image.

    <p style="font-size:25px;">Painting of a Long Cat</p>
    <img src="https://chrispittman16.github.io/cpittman/images/LongCat.jpg">
  </p>
     <b>Kitten by Judith Linhares</b>
    Not only does the body of the cat appear to be elongated, but the wy his head is turned and how it's painted 
    is funny to me. It just looks like his whole head is morphed in this weird looking way where his face is made
    longer, and his right ear is almost right above his right eye.
