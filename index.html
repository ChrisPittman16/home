   <b>Trash Possum by FreemanArtpocalypse</b>
    I think possums are adorable, despite the reputation they often get. This little guy is just enjoying his meal, he's even got his little crown.

     <b>Le Chat Blanc by Pierre Bonnard</b>
    I am unsure as to why this artist (or any artist in the medieval or renaissance era), decided to make the cat the way they did, but I absolutely love it and have a strange fascination for it.

     <b>Artwork of Kevin the cat by Vanessa Stockard</b>
     Somehow the giant yellow eyes and lack of other facial features and ears, as well as how small he 
    looks with that neck ruff around his neck, make this look like some exotic alien creature.

     <b>Real Life</b>
    How is this even possible? Who knows?!? Maybe it's a really light Capybara, maybe it's a really strong stork, I am not knowlegable about how either of these animals work. Just enjoy this image.
